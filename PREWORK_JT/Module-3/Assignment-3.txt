Key #5, 'Not a spectator sport' will be the most difficult key for me to overcome. I've tried teaching myself new coding languages, but have failed many times because I feel I'm not coding perfectly. So I keep watching different tutorials, guides and talks instead of coding. Eventually I loose interest and become overwhelmed trying to decide the best way to code. I will try to just code - even if it is inefficient and dirty because I know I will get better with time and more practice.
