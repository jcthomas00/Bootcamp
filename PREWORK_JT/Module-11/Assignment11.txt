Unfortunately, I read the 11th module a little too late to implement it so I figured I would talk about the last meeting I had with a client at work. I was supposed to pitch a new custom site to the client (UTHealth Graduate Medical School) and was only given 3 hours to prepare for this situation. I was a nervous wreck inside but I projected confidence to my supervisors. In the 3 hours I created a basic mock-up to have a visual component for the pitch. By the time Angela walked in my office I had build up enough confidence to talk her through the basic services we could offer on the website. Using the mock-up and previous client sites, I showed her the embedded maps, slider images and other snazzy features to try and impress her. While Angela was satisfied with the site, she explained that she didnâ€™t like my choice of pictures for the hero images and the way I worded certain things. I resisted the urge to defend my choice of images or explain that I had only 3 hours to make the page and thus my choice of should be excused. Angela was affirming but also conveyed any apprehensions and doubts she had which led to a productive and collaborative meeting. I was surprised at how calm I had become by the end of the meeting and how I was able to portray a professional and friendly demeanor.
